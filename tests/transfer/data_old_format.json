These questions will be situational and participants will be required to use critical thinking and problem solving abilities to reach the top of the board. The right answer would take them to a ladder and let them advance while a wrong answer will lead them down a snake. 16 finalists will be selected from the first round based on the number of moves made to clear the board. The final round will be a battle of wits and will require the participants to think spontaneously. The top 3 winners who take the least time to clear the board will be declared the winners and will be awarded the prize money.",

Further, we will invite registered VIT members to interact with the kids with the motto of 'each one teach one' where they can teach the kids interesting ideas or tell them about experiences from their lives.

Entailing four rounds of carefully handpicked games, Bulls and Bears VIT welcomes all the participants to take a set out on this convivial endeavor. To be sports as well, we have a sneak peek at what CASINOVA will go through:\nThe first round is our very own Bear Pong. A total of 10 glasses with 4 of them containing a piece of papyrus with one random number on them. Ping-pong balls will be thrown from the other side of the neatly arranged glasses, and an individual from the team will continue until they find the four chits, which in turn is the key to the enigma of the number lock to free their teammate.\nWe advance into the second round, Jeopardy. The teams will have to compete in a trivia contest, where they will be presented with choices encompassing 4 themes and 3 difficulties Easy, Medium, and Hard with 2, 4, and 6 points respectively. To transition into the third round, the teams must get 15 points with the minimum number of questions chosen.\nThe third round we have in store is the Marble Run. Open-top pipes and a set of marbles mark this round where teammates must work together to get one marble at a time using the open-topped pipes from one end of the room to the other side, into a small container waiting for the team. \nThe Final Round of CASINOVA is a game of high cunning, Split Or Steal Split or Steal is a game in which players take turns choosing to either split a pot of money evenly among all players or steal the entire pot for themselves. The game typically starts with a small amount of money in the pot, and in each round, players can choose to add money to the pot or take the money for themselves. If a player chooses to steal the money, the game ends and that player wins the entire pot. If a player chooses to split the money, the game continues and the next player must make a choice.\nThe team that completes the game in the minimum time wins CASINOVA .",
